Return a **valid JSON array** where each element is an object:
  {
    "id": <string>,                # unique slug, e.g. "A-1"
    "text": <string>,              # one-sentence, measurable objective
    "bloom": <string>,             # one of: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create
    "cluster": <string>            # short thematic label, max 3 words
  }

Rules:
- Do NOT wrap the JSON in markdown fences.
- Each objective must start with a Bloom verb (Define, Explain, Compute, â€¦).
- Objectives should be small enough to test with a single free-response question.
- Ignore prefaces, anecdotes, or typographic noise in the chapter.
- Maximum 25 objectives per call.`;
